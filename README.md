# A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?


In this project, we will use our data manipulation and visualization skills to explore patterns and trends over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners.
We will try to find out answers to various questions like: What characteristics do the prize winners have? Which country gets it most often? Is their any bias between award winners? And has anybody gotten it twice?
